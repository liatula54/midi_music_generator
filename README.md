# midi_music_generator
The architecture used in this project is a Sequence of notes and chords from all songs using Recurrent Neural Network with 2 LSTM layers .The network will made a prediction of the next note (or chord), based on the previous sequence notes (or chords). The base model is fed a input vector from data set to the LSTMâ€™s which then generates the frequency vector as output .
